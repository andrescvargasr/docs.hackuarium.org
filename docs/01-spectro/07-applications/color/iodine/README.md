# Determination of the concentration in oxigenated water (H2O2) using potassium iodine (KI)

## Goal

Find appropriate solutions concentrations of H2O2 and KI to realize experiments using the simple-spectro.

**Caution:** H2O2 is dangerous: it is really exothermic when mixed with acid. It can explode. Avoid contact with skin. On the contrary, KI is totally fine, since it is even sometimes ingested for medical purpose.

## Principle

Two solutions are required: a solution of H2O2 and a solution of KI. The goal is to mix them together having an excess of KI so that all the H2O2 reacts and results in iodine, which is brown and can be measured using a spectrophotometer.

## First batch of solutions

We realized solutions at 0.1 M. To do so, we placed 4.15 g (measured using a scale, precision: 0.001g) of KI in a 250 ml calibrated flask and completed with deionized water, agitating well to dissolve all the KI (room temperature is sufficient). Similarly, place 2.5 ml of 30% H2O2 in a 250 ml calibrated flask and complete with deionized water.

To measure the color, we mixed 4ml of the KI solution with 1 ml of the H2O2 solution.

**Measures of absorbance:**

- red: 0.00
- green: 0.04
- blue: 0.06

**Conclusion:** Solutions were not concentrated enough. We tried with solutions 10 times more concentrated.

## Second batch of solutions

4 mL KI 1M
1 mL H2O2 1M

## Second batch of solutions

4 mL KI 0.1M
1 mL H2O2 0.1M
1 mL AcOH 1M

**Measures of absorbance:**

- red: 0.10
- green: 0.54
- blue: 1.66

## Third batch

A : KI 0.1M
B : AcOH 1M
C : H2O2 0.1M
D : H2O
