# E133 - Briliant blue

## Exploratory experiments

The goal is to evaluate the concentration required to have an absorbance of around 0.5.

We took 427.0 mg in 100mL of water.

From this we placed 0.5mL in 100mL.

### 21 mg/L

| Color | Absorbance | Emission |
| ----- | ---------- | -------- |
| Red   | 1.04       |          |
| Green | 0.04       |          |
| Blue  | 0.10       |          |
| UV    |            | 0        |

### 10.5 mg/L

| Color | Absorbance | Emission |
| ----- | ---------- | -------- |
| Red   | 0.61       |          |
| Green | 0.05       |          |
| Blue  | 0.01       |          |
| UV    |            | 8        |

### Conclusions

We need around 9 mg/L to have an absorbance in red of around 0.5.
