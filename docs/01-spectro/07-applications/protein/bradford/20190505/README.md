# Trying Bradford test `from scratch`

The previous experiments using the commercial products where not that convincing and we are not sure why.

We therefore decided to repeat the original experiment using commercially available products:

- BSA (5g on ebay)
- Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 CI42665 Acid Blue 90 (5g on ebay)

And based on the original publication from [Marion M. Bardford](<https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-2697(76)90527-3>)

The current version of the spectrophotometer only allows 3mL cells and from the protocol we will therefore use the _Protein assay (standard method)_.

For the standard protocol we need:

- 10 to 100Âµg of protein in 0.1 mL (NaCl 0.15M) (0.1g to 1g per liter)
- 5mL protein reagent

## Solution of NaCl 0.15M

500 mL of NaCl 0.15M:
4.38 g to 250 mL

## Protein solutions

We prepare 10mL of BSA solution: 10mg in 0.15NaCl (1g/L)

## Bradfort reagent

- 100 mg of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 in 50mL ethanol 95%
- 100 mL 85% (w/v) phosphoric acid
- complete to 1L

We will prepare 50mL of the reagent but we have only H2SO4 2N

- 4 mg of oomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 in 5mL ethanol 95%
- 10 mL of H2SO4 1M (2N)
- bring to 100mL with water
