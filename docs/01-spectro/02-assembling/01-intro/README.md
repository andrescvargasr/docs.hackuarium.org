## The Simple-Spectro kit

A Simple-Spectro kit is composed of four little bags:

- **A**: Contains the PCB (the electronic board)
- **B**: Contains all of the components that you'll need to solder on the PCB
- **C**: Contains the different parts of the case (the case itself and all the screws)
- **D**: Contains the supplies that you'll need once the construction is finished (like a mini USB cable, a sticker, ...)
