# Stability

In order to evaluate the stability of the spectrophotometer, 48 experiments were done without delay.

This experiment was repeated twice on `D1`.

The variation for RGB is less than 0.1%.

The experiment was redone using a delay of 600s between each acquisition. The main variation is probably due to temperature changes. We observe that the changes can now reach up to 0.5% and are depend on the color.

In order to confirm the importance of the temperature, the experiment was repeated with the acquisition of the temperature.

We can clearly see an inverted correlation between the red variation and the temperature.
