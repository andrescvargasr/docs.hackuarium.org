# Goal of the project

This project was done at the [Hackuarium](http://www.hackuarium.ch/en/) association, a DIY biology hacking-space and open laboratory located in Ecublens (Switzerland). Feel free to [contact us](https://form.jotformeu.com/71600609780354) if you would like additional information or would like to buy a fully built and tested pHMeter.

Recently, the open-source and open-hardware community has been involved in the creation of open scientific tools. In this context, a few pH and conductivity projects emerged. However, none of them was sufficiently evolved to be casually used in a laboratory. It is for this reason that we started this project.

Our goal was to create a simple pH and conductivity meter reliable, precise and cheap.

## Cloning the project

All the code since the first day is open-source and you may get the code on: `https://github.com/Hackuarium/phmeter`.

This project uses SUBMODULES.

In order to clone it use:

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Hackuarium/phmeter/`

To update the submodules:

`git submodule update --recursive --remote`
