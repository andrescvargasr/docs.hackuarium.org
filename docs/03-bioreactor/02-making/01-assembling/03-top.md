## Loading cells

:::note
To avoid any pressure on load cells, you need to put the packing rings between loading cell and case.

:::caution
Take care! There is only one correct conection between the loading cells and case, if you connect for the incorrect side, you have problems with PCB connection.

:::note
Look the hole positions for every loading cell cable.
