# Components

## Introduction

This manual describes how to assemble a functional bioreactor once the PCB plate has been ready and the pieces for the casing have been laser cutted.

The bioreactor is composed of three distinct layers, as can be seen on the following image:

1. **The base:** It is the piece on which the bioreactor stands. It contains the main PCB, as well as the peristaltic pumps and the LCD screen.
2. **The heating plate:** Placed on top of the base, it heats the recipient in which are placed our materials of interest.
3. **The recipient:** It contains the solution in which will be placed our cultures and materials of interest.

## Material required for reactor assembly

**[To be completed]**

For heating plate case:

1. Part `A` of the cases
2. Part `B` of the cases
3. Dichloromethane
4. Heating plate
5. Isolation for heating plate
6. Black silicone
7. 2 pin connector

### General

1. Solder station.
2. Tin.
3. Solder paste.

## Assembling the casing

The first step to assemble the bioreactor is to put the casing together. In this part, we will discuss the base only. Explanation on how to assemble the heating plate will come in a [dedicated section](#readying-the-heating-cell).

First, identify the parts you are dealing with. In the following image are shown all the parts required to build the base.

:::note
Sections `A` and `B` are the base for the heating plate.

Sections `C` and `D` for the main board.

| A   | DESCRIPTION        |
| :-- | ------------------ |
| 1   | Heating plate base |

| B   | DESCRIPTION |
| :-- | ----------- |
| 1   | Front       |
| 2   | Behind      |
| 3   | Left        |
| 4   | Right       |

| C   | DESCRIPTION |
| :-- | ----------- |
| 1   | Top         |
| 2   | Bottom      |

| D   | DESCRIPTION |
| :-- | ----------- |
| 1   | Right       |
| 2   | Left        |
| 3   | Front       |
| 4   | Behind      |

Tape all parts together **except `Top`** and glue them with _dichloromethane_. Wait about 10 minutes until the solvent has dried out. When assembling, please beware of the following details:

:::caution

- On the `Bottom` part, the 4 small holes designed for the screws that will support the PCB should be on the `Front` when looking from the front of the bioreactor.
- The part containing only one big circular hole for the pump `Right` should be on the right side when looking from the front and the holes should be in the back.
- The part containing the two big circular holes for the pump and fan `Left` should be on the left side when looking from the front and the holes should be in the back.
