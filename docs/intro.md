# Hackuarium documentation

Welcome to this site, which contains the documentation of some open-hardware projects led at the [Hackuarium bio-hacking space](https://www.hackuarium.ch) located in Ã‰cublens, Switzerland. You can navigate in the sidebar on the left part of your screen to see the doc written for our projects.

If you are a little bit familiar with MarkDown and GitHub please feel free to correct and / or contribute to the documentation. There is an 'edit' button in the bottom of all the pages.
